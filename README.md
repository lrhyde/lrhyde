### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Lauren Hyde, and I'm a computer science student in UIUC's Grainger School of Engineering. I have experience in many different areas of computer science, but my particular areas of interest are data science and web app development. I'm working on various personal projects in web development which are posted here on GitHub.
